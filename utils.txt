int execve(const char *path, char *const argv[], char *envp[]);

# path: the path to our command
        type `which ls` and `which wc` in your terminal
        you'll see the exact path to the commands' binaries

# argv[]: the args the command needs, for ex. `ls -la`
          you can use your ft_split to obtain a char **
          like this { "ls", "-la", NULL }
          it must be null terminated

# envp: the environmental variable
        you can simply retrieve it in your main (see below)
        and pass it onto execve, no need to do anything here
        in envp you'll see a line PATH which contains all possible
        paths to the commands' binaries
